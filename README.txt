The program to be executed is in the SoftwareProjectDay folder,
called Main.java.
When the program is executed, it begins immediately initializing objects
and preparing to start the "day." It then starts all the threads through
a latch. There is no user input needed.

As of right now there are no configurable constants that can be safely
changed in the code.

Presently, the program has no output.
